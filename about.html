            <p>
              Bahama Mama's was established by Renee and Emily (a mother & daughter team) in 2005.    Their fun loving spirit, along with the festive flair of their decor, captured customers.    Not only did they make a beautiful store....but they offered a large variety of clothing, jewelry and gifts at affordable prices!   and a colorful festive vibe.  Making  Bahama Mama's  a huge hit in Flagler Beach.

It was later purchased by Laurie Holtzendorf in 2014.  The store kept the same charm and great prices, but slowly took on a new look and acquired more merchandise.   Then in 2018 Bahama Mama's  really transformed when they moved to their new location up on A1A. ( approximately 150 feet South of the Flagler Pier.)

We still have great merchandise at fantastic prices and quite a following!!!  If you haven't been into our boutique yet......you need to make a visit and check out this truly unique one of a kind magical boutique!

            <h1>About the Owner</h1>
            <p>

              Laurie Holtzendorf has lived in the area for over thirty years and was a regular customer at Bahama Mama's. One day, she causally mentioned that if they ever wanted to sell to let her know.........in the Fall of 2014 she became owner of Bahama Mama's.

    Laurie's background is started with a degree in "Marketing,& Advertising" however, she followed her heart and spent many years in the marine industry.  It started with boat building and then she obtained her 100 Ton captains license (delivering vessels) and then after many "in-between jobs" she landed her "career" with NOAA (National Oceanic Administration Association) as a Hydrographic Surveyor.

    The love of the ocean is still her heart.......so it's not surprising that her home and business sit waterfront.  Of course, when not at Bahama Mama's she can be found doing one of her many hobbies, which include, paddleboarding, kiteboarding, sailing, spearfishing, surfing and boating.   Ironically, although not water related,  she spent 10 years racing motocross and says it was the best years of her life!

     Her view:
     "I let my passion and adrenaline lead me. Those journey's were the most incredible experiences of my life. Yes, there was pain attached to some of it, but what doesn't kill you only makes you stonger!  "
